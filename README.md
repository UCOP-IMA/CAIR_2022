We will assume participants have general digital literacy, as well as familiarity with common areas of IR involving using benchmark data as comparison. However, no specific technical knowledge of programming in Python, or using the web-hosted service Google Colab, will be assumed. In addition, we will assume participants have a relatively modern laptop with reliable broadband Internet access, as well as a Google account.


Accounts Needed
In order to interact with code examples, accounts for the following two online services will be needed:

Google

We'll be using Google accounts to run code examples in https://colab.research.google.com/
If you don't already have a Google Account, you can create one for free at https://accounts.google.com/signup

o test your setup, please follow the instructions in our Setup Test Colab Notebook. If desired, you can use the File -> Save a Copy in Drive command to save a copy of the results.

All in-class examples assume the use of Google Colab, and we will not be able to provide support for any other setup.

After successfully completing this class, we will be equipped for the following:

Participants in this session will be able to recognize when Python could be used to solve common IR problems. Participants in this session will be able to generate mock datasets for testing techniques without student privacy concerns.
