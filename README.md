We will assume participants have general digital literacy, as well as familiarity with common areas of IR involving using benchmark data as comparison. However, no specific technical knowledge of programming in Python, or using the web-hosted service Google Colab, will be assumed. In addition, we will assume participants have a relatively modern laptop with reliable broadband Internet access, as well as a Google account.

**To get started for today:**

**Google**: If you don't already have a Google Account, you can create one for free at https://accounts.google.com/signup

**After successfully completing this class, we will be equipped for the following:**
Participants in this session will be able to recognize when Python could be used to solve common IR problems. Participants in this session will be able to generate mock datasets for testing techniques without student privacy concerns.
